# RNA_Seq

## Introduction
The idea of this repository is to collect and share with colleagues some basic steps for RNA-Seq data processsing and analysis, together with relevant resources used to generate the different steps and scripts. 

## Credits
Credits for the script assembled here should be given to the [**rnaseq_tutorial**](https://github.com/griffithlab/rnaseq_tutorial) from the [**griffithlab**](https://github.com/griffithlab).

## Resources
The data processing described here was done on the HPC cluster [**ubelix**](https://ubelix.unibe.ch/) from the Unviersity of Bern. The relevant documentation to access the cluster and the User Guide are available [**here**](https://hpc-unibe-ch.github.io/).

## Data used 
As example to assemble and test an RNA-Seq workflow we will use previously published data from an RNA-Seq experiment conducted on primary tumor samples and organoids of bladder cancer. The data are accessible on GEO [**here**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE103990).
